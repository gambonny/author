/**
 * Middleware that enforces presence of the `traceparent` header.
 *
 * This acts as a structural contract: every incoming request must be
 * traceable to a client-triggered interaction. By requiring a traceparent ID:
 *
 * - We guarantee that no request enters the system without an identifiable origin.
 * - We enable end-to-end correlation between consumers actions and backend logs.
 * - We reduce attack surface by rejecting unstructured or synthetic traffic.
 *
 * Requests missing this header are rejected with a vague 400 response,
 * preserving system intent without revealing internal requirements.
 *
 * This middleware should run first, before logger setup or route handling.
